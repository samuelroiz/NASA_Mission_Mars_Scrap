# NASA_Mission_Mars_Scrap

## About this project

In this assignment, it is a built web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. Used Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data. Also used Pymongo for CRUD applications for the database. The application is overwritten in the existing document each time the /scrape url is visited and new data is obtained. The project uses Bootstrap to structure the HTML template.
