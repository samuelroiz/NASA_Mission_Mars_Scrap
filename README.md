# NASA_Mission_Mars_Scrap

## About this project

This assignment involved building a web application that scrapes data from multiple websites related to the Mission to Mars and presents it on a single HTML page. The project utilized tools like Splinter for site navigation, BeautifulSoup for data extraction, Pymongo for database CRUD operations, and the application refreshes the document each time the /scrape URL is visited to obtain new data, while Bootstrap was used to structure the HTML template.
